# Zone-Boundary Phonon Mode in Ferroelectric Material

## Introduction
This project focuses on the analysis of a zone-boundary phonon mode, denoted as K3, occurring in an improper ferroelectric material, YMnO3. In the paraelectric phase, this phonon mode exhibits harmonic vibrations. The objective is to solve the Schrödinger wave equation to determine the ground state energy ($E_0$) and the energies of five higher states immediately above $E_0$. $\Psi$

## Phonon Mode Description
The zone-boundary phonon mode K3 involves the displacement of atoms, leading to distinct vibrational behavior. Visual representations of these atomic displacements are typically depicted.

## Potential Energy
- **Paraelectric Phase:** The phonon mode vibrates within a harmonic potential.
- The Schrödinger equation for a quantum system with the given potential energy V is:
-$\ \frac{hbar^2}{2m} \Nabla^2 $\Psi$ + V $\Psi$ = E $\Psi$$

Where:
- $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.
- m is the mass of the particle.
- $\Nabla^2 is the Laplacian operator, representing the second spatial derivative with respect to position.
- V is the potential energy operator defined as $\ V = K_0 + K_2x^2$.
- E is the total energy of the quantum system.
- $\Psi$ is the wavefunction of the system, representing the quantum state of the particle.

This equation describes the behavior of a quantum particle in the presence of a potential energy \(V\) and is used to determine the energy eigenvalues (\(E\)) and corresponding eigenfunctions (\(\Psi\)) of the system.


## Objectives
1. Solve the Schrödinger wave equation to find the ground state energy (E0).
2. Determine the energies of the five immediate energy levels above E0.
